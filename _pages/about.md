I'm Joe Bak-Coleman a computational social scientist and postdoctoral fellow at the [University of Washington Center for an Informed Public](https://www.cip.uw.edu/) and the [eScience Institute](https://escience.washington.edu/). I earned my PhD in [Ecology and Evolutionary](https://eeb.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University in 2020, working with [Iain Couzin](https://collectivebehaviour.com/people/couzin-iain/) and [Dan Rubenstein](https://eeb.princeton.edu/people/daniel-rubenstein).

My research is broadly focused on understanding how the actions and interactions of individuals give rise to patterns of collective behavior. I'm particularly interested in how collectives make decision when faced with uncertainty. This is a common problem faced by nervous systems, animal groups, scientists and human society alike. My research focuses on understanding commonalities across these systems and discerning what makes collectives work and how they go awry. Over the past decade this has led my work from nervous systems and animal groups to my current focus on understanding the consequences of social media at scale.
