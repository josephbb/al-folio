   abstract = {Predation is one of the main evolutionary drivers of social grouping. While it is well appreciated that predation risk is likely not shared equally among individuals within groups, its detailed quantification has remained difficult due to the speed of attacks and the highly dynamic nature of collective prey response. Here, using high-resolution tracking of solitary predators (Northern pike) hunting schooling fish (golden shiners), we not only provide insights into predator decision-making, but show which key spatial and kinematic features of predator and prey predict the risk of individuals to be targeted and to survive attacks. We found that pike tended to stealthily approach the largest groups, and were often already inside the school when launching their attack, making prey in this frontal ‘strike zone’ the most vulnerable to be targeted. From the prey’s perspec-tive, those fish in central locations, but relatively far from, and less aligned with, neighbours, were most likely to be targeted. While the majority of attacks were successful (70%), targeted individuals that did manage to avoid being captured exhibited a higher maximum acceleration response just before the attack and were further away from the pike‘s head. Our results highlight the crucial interplay between predators’ attack strategy and response of prey underlying the predation risk within mobile animal groups.},

@article{Winklmayr2020TheAccuracy,
   abstract = {Groups of organisms, from bacteria to fish schools to human societies, depend on their ability to make accurate decisions in an uncertain world. Most models of collective decision-making assume that groups reach a consensus during a decision-making bout, often through simple majority rule. In many natural and sociological systems, however, groups may fail to reach consensus, resulting in stalemates. Here, we build on opinion dynamics and collective wisdom models to examine how stalemates may affect the wisdom of crowds. For simple environments, where individuals have access to independent sources of information, we find that stalemates improve collective accuracy by selectively filtering out incorrect decisions (an effect we call stalemate filtering). In complex environments, where individuals have access to both shared and independent information, this effect is even more pronounced, restoring the wisdom of crowds in regions of parameter space where large groups perform poorly when making decisions using majority rule. We identify network properties that tune the system between consensus and accuracy, providing mechanisms by which animals, or evolution, could dynamically adjust the collective decision-making process in response to the reward structure of the possible outcomes. Overall, these results highlight the adaptive potential of stalemate filtering for improving the decision-making abilities of group-living animals.},

@article{Sosna2019IndividualGroups,
   abstract = {The need to make fast decisions under risky and uncertain conditions is a widespread problem in the natural world. While there has been extensive work on how individual organisms dynamically modify their behavior to respond appropriately to changing environmental conditions (and how this is encoded in the brain), we know remarkably little about the corresponding aspects of collective information processing in animal groups. For example, many groups appear to show increased “sensitivity” in the presence of perceived threat, as evidenced by the increased frequency and magnitude of repeated cascading waves of behavioral change often observed in fish schools and bird flocks under such circumstances. How such context-dependent changes in collective sensitivity are mediated, however, is unknown. Here we address this question using schooling fish as a model system, focusing on 2 nonexclusive hypotheses: 1) that changes in collective responsiveness result from changes in how individuals respond to social cues (i.e., changes to the properties of the “nodes” in the social network), and 2) that they result from changes made to the structural connectivity of the network itself (i.e., the computation is encoded in the “edges” of the network). We find that despite the fact that perceived risk increases the probability for individuals to initiate an alarm, the context-dependent change in collective sensitivity predominantly results not from changes in how individuals respond to social cues, but instead from how individuals modify the spatial structure, and correspondingly the topology of the network of interactions, within the group. Risk is thus encoded as a collective property, emphasizing that in group-living species individual fitness can depend strongly on coupling between scales of behavioral organization.},

@article{Li2020,
   abstract = {It has long been proposed that flying and swimming animals could exploit neighbour-induced flows. Despite this it is still not clear whether, and if so how, schooling fish coordinate their movement to benefit from the vortices shed by others. To address this we developed bio-mimetic fish-like robots which allow us to measure directly the energy consumption associated with swimming together in pairs (the most common natural configuration in schooling fish). We find that followers, in any relative position to a near-neighbour, could obtain hydrodynamic benefits if they exhibit a tailbeat phase difference that varies linearly with front-back distance, a strategy we term ‘vortex phase matching’. Experiments with pairs of freely-swimming fish reveal that followers exhibit this strategy, and that doing so requires neither a functioning visual nor lateral line system. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that fish typically, but not exclusively, use vortex phase matching to save energy. Whether and how fish might benefit from swimming in schools is an ongoing intriguing debate. Li et al. conduct experiments with biomimetic robots and also with real fish to reveal a new behavioural strategy by which followers can exploit the vortices shed by a near neighbour.},

We begin by deriving a generative model of viral misinformation spread, inspired by research on infectious disease. By applying this model to a large corpus (10.5 million tweets) of misinformation events that occurred during the 2020 US election, we reveal that commonly proposed interventions are unlikely to be effective in isolation.

@article{Coombs2020,
   abstract = {Here, we review fish rheotaxis (orientation to flow) with the goal of placing it within a larger behavioral and multisensory context. Rheotaxis is a flexible behavior that is used by fish in a variety of circumstances: to search for upstream sources of current-borne odors, to intercept invertebrate drift and, in general, to conserve energy while preventing downstream displacement. Sensory information available for rheotaxis includes water-motion cues to the lateral line and body-motion cues to visual, vestibular or tactile senses when fish are swept downstream. Although rheotaxis can be mediated by a single sense, each sense has its own limitations. For example, lateral line cues are limited by the spatial characteristics of flow, visual cues by water visibility, and vestibular and other body-motion cues by the ability of fish to withstand downstream displacement. The ability of multiple senses to compensate for any single-sense limitation enables rheotaxis to persist over a wide range of sensory and flow conditions. Here, we propose a mechanism of rheotaxis that can be activated in parallel by one or more senses; a major component of this mechanism is directional selectivity of central neurons to broad patterns of water and/or body motions. A review of central mechanisms for vertebrate orienting behaviors and optomotor reflexes reveals several motorsensory integration sites in the CNS that could be involved in rheotaxis. As such, rheotaxis provides an excellent opportunity for understanding the multisensory control of a simple vertebrate behavior and how a simple motor act is integrated with others to form complex behaviors.},

   abstract = {Many fish exhibit rheotaxis, a behavior in which fish orient themselves relative to flow. Rheotaxis confers many benefits, including energetic cost savings and interception of drifting prey. Despite the fact that most species of fish school during at least some portion of their life, little is known about the importance of rheotactic behavior to schooling fish and, conversely, how the presence of nearby conspecifics affects rheotactic behavior. Understanding how rheotaxis is modified by social factors is thus of ecological importance. Here we present a mathematical model in the form of an all-to-all, coupled-oscillator framework over the non-Euclidean space of fish orientations to model group rheotactic behavior. Individuals in the model measure the orientation of their neighbors and the flow direction relative to their own orientation. These measures are corrupted by sensory noise. We study the effect of sensory noise and group size on internal (i.e., within the school) and external (i.e., with the flow) disagreement in orientation. We find that under noisy environmental conditions, increased group size improves rheotaxis. Results of this study have implications for understanding animal behavior, as well as for potential applications in bio-inspired engineering.},

   abstract = {When encountering a unidirectional flow, many fish exhibit an unconditioned orienting response known as rheotaxis. This multisensory behavior can reportedly involve visual, vestibular, tactile and lateral line cues. However, the precise circumstances under which different senses contribute are still unclear and there is considerable debate, in particular, about the contributions of the lateral line. In this study, we investigate the rheotactic behavior of blind cavefish under conditions of spatially non-uniform flow (a jet stream), which in theory, should promote reliance on lateral line cues. The behavior of individual lateral line enabled and disabled fish was videorecorded under IR light in a square arena that prevented streamwise biases and that contained a narrowjet streamin the centerof the tank.Whereas the stream speak velocity (8 cm s-1) declined very little in the streamwise direction, it declined steeply in the cross-stream direction (∼3-4.5 cm s-1 cm-1). Lateral line enabled fish showed higher levels of orientation to the stream and its source (a 1-cm-wide nozzle) when in the central ( jet stream) region of the tank compared with surrounding regions,whereas lateral line disabled fish showedrandomorientations in all regions of the tank. The results of this study indicate that the spatial characteristics of flow play a role in determining the sensory basis of rheotaxis.},

   abstract = {Movement through an environment provides sighted organisms with dynamic visual cues known as optic flow. In flying insects, optic flow is important for collision avoidance, flight speed control and landing manoeuvres. The function of optic flow is much less understood in other taxa, particularly in fish. Despite a lack of quantitative studies, optomotor responses (OMRs) to optic flow are presumed to be nearly ubiquitously important for rheotaxis (orientation to currents), a widespread behaviour that confers a number of benefits, including energy conservation. Here we show that while very young larval zebrafish, Danio rerio, exhibit positive OMRs (swim in the direction of optic flow), thereby minimizing optic flow on the retina, older larvae and adults exhibit negative OMRs that increase optic flow. While the reason for this reversal remains unclear, negative OMRs are inconsistent with optically driven positive rheotaxis (orienting upstream). Furthermore, when optic flow cues are placed in conflict with nonvisual (mechanical) cues generated by water currents, adult fish largely ignore the optic flow cues relying instead on nonvisual cues. These results challenge a century-old belief that optic flow and the resulting OMRs are a dominant sensorimotor mechanism in rheotaxis, highlighting the importance of future work on life history changes in OMRs and the possible modulatory influence of learned, multisensory expectations.},

Visual (optic flow) cues appear to be sufficient for rheotaxis, but other sensory cues can clearly compensate for the loss of vision. The role of various nonvisual sensory systems, in particular the flow-sensing lateral line, is poorly understood, largely because of widely varying methods and sensory conditions for studying rheotaxis. Here, we examine how sedentary behavior under visually deprived conditions affects the relative importance of lateral line cues in two species: one that is normally sedentary (the three-lined corydoras, Corydoras trilineatus) and one that normally swims continuously along the substrate (the blind cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus). No effect of lateral line disruption on rheotactic performance was found in blind cavefish, which were significantly more mobile than three-lined corydoras. By contrast, rheotaxis was significantly impaired at low, but not high, flow speeds in lateral-line-disabled corydoras. In addition, lateral-lineenabled corydoras were characterized by decreased mobility and increased rheotactic performance relative to lateral-line-disabled fish. Taken together, these results suggest that sedentary behavior is an important factor in promoting reliance on lateral line cues.},

The instantaneous position and heading of each D. aequipinnatus was extracted from high-speed videos. Behavioural results indicate that (1) school structure is altered in flow such that D. aequipinnatus orient upstream while spanning out in a crosswise direction, (2) the probability of at least one D. aequipinnatus detecting the visual looming stimulus is higher in flow than no flow for both solitary D. aequipinnatus and groups of eight D. aequipinnatus; however, (3) the probability of three or more individuals responding is higher in no flow than in flow. These results indicate a higher probability of stimulus detection in flow but a higher probability of internal transmission of information in no flow. Finally, results were well predicted by a computational model of collective fright response that included the probability of direct detection (based on signal detection theory) and indirect detection (i.e. via interactions between group members) of threatening stimuli. This model provides a new theoretical framework for analysing the collective transfer of information among groups of fishes and other organisms.

   abstract = {Rheotaxis is a robust, multisensory behavior with many potential benefits for fish and other aquatic organisms. Visual (optic flow) cues appear to be sufficient for rheotaxis, but other sensory cues can clearly compensate for the loss of vision. Nevertheless, the nature of multisensory interactions and the relative contributions of different senses under varying conditions are poorly understood - largely because there is so little description of the actual behavior. Here, we examined the effects of different flow speeds and different sensory conditions on the spatiotemporal dynamics of rheotaxis. Although the overall ability of giant danio (Devario aequipinnatus) to head upstream is largely unaffected by either unimodal or bimodal deprivation of visual and/or lateral line senses, the spatiotemporal form of the behavior is altered in subtle ways. When deprived of vision, fish move further upstream, but the angular accuracy of the upstream heading is reduced. In addition, visually deprived fish exhibit left/right sweeping movements near the upstream barrier at low flow speeds. Sweeping movements are abolished when these fish are additionally deprived of lateral line information. These results indicate that fish adopt different sensorimotor strategies to compensate for the loss of one or more senses and that the nature of multisensory interactions is a complex function of flow speed. © 2013.
