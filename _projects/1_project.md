We have built and adopted technology that alters behavior at global scales without a theory of what will happen or a coherent strategy for reducing harm. Much of my research focuses on understanding the emergent consequences of digital communication technology and identifying strategies to reduce harm.

Trained as an ecologist, I spent the early years of my PhD surrounded by researchers studying our natural world. Although they worked on systems ranging in scale from viruses to global climate, much of the work shared a common theme of understanding the impact of human activity on once-stable complex systems. Through technological innovation and subsequent over-exploitation, our natural world now exists in a precarious state that requires an urgent, evidence-based response.

My research takes this framing and applies it to human social behavior. Over the past 12,000 years, we've gone solving local problems vocally to being faced with global challenges and communicating through smartphones. Much like our natural systems, digital communication technology has been developed largely to mine our attention for profit. There is no reason to believe that these changes will bring about a healthy, equitable and sustainable world. Along with co-authors across the natural, physical, an social sciences, we published a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2025764118"> paper </a> in PNAS arguing that our global collective behavior is in urgent need of stewardship.

This project emerged from a workshop hosted in 2017 on Princeton's campus and remains ongoing. Since that time it has broadened out to involve researchers at over a dozen institutions. We brougt these researchers together with experts in tech and policy for a <a  <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2021-12/social-media-crisis-discipline">recent workshop</a> hosted by the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/programs/institute-rebooting-social-media"><i>Institute for for rebooting social media</i></a> at Harvard University.
